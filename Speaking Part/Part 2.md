## Part 2

### 事件类（描述一件你的经历）

新：小学活动；他人制造噪音；投诉；街市购物；忙碌经历；年少学艺；捡到失物；延期旅行；帮助他人；户外活动；匆忙做事；使用地图；和老人的有趣对话



## Start up

I‘m going to talk about a time when...

Speaking of +[题目], I would like to mention a time when...

When it comes to +[题目], I would like to mention a time when...



## When/where/who

1. When:

It was about+几年+ago if my memory serves me right. At that time...

加原因和细节，那个时候具体在干什么，怎么能和题目中要做的事产生联系？

e.g. 

1. had a tough week+need to refresh myself
2. just finished exams+had been cramming for exam
3. on the summer vacation+had plenty of time at hand.

分为绝对时间和相对时间，具体日期（多久之前）和那段时间是自己人生阶段的什么时期？



2. Where:

We started from...(places), and we went towards 目的地

It happened in..., which is my.../,which is near ...

同样对于单时间以及地点的回答用第二句，如果是一个多地点长时间的就用第一句。

这里能多加一些细节就加一些，比如这个地方有什么特点之类的，又或者这条路线有什么特点之类的。



3. Who:

I went on the trip, like I mentioned, with a bunch of my buddy/friends/family...

之后加上细节，假设是朋友的话，就加上认识的时间，since什么时候

We've been close friend since.../We've known each other for..

We have an amazingly strong bond with each other and also enjoy each other's company.

也可以强调一下与朋友之间的关联之类的。

也可以强调在做这件事情之前，什么原因导致了你选择和这些朋友一起发生这件事。



### 起因经过结果(what happened)

**开始：**

In the beginning,...

At first,...

On the first day,...

The first thing we did was...

The first place we went to was...



**然后：**

Afterwards,...

After that,...

Then,...

And then later,...

On the next day,...

The next thing that we did was...

After we had done something, we did...



**同时：**

When/While I was ..., I...

Meanwhile,...

At the same time,...



**结束：**
In the end,...

At last,...

Finally,...

The last thing that we did was...



在描述事情的时候，一定要加入细节，可以多强调”第一次“来突出特别性。

加入对比：比如说可以先说自己在之前的生活或者习惯中或者文化中，这件事情应该是怎么样的，但是在这一件事情中，一切变得跟之前不同，然后强调一下新奇与特别性。

如果说是景色的话，可以多描述一些细节，比如说海景，雪景，山景，人景，事物的景之类的，总之为了凑字数可以多加一些，没有坏处，这也是为了Part3打好基础的。

也可以代入当时的情景，当时为什么要这么做？当时的感受是什么？多加一些心理描写。

但是通常来说，可以加入一个mix也就是转折来让feeling更加丰富，通常来说可以以这样的思路：虽然过程很累，但是却很有收获。

e.g. Overall, the car trip was fantastic. We had a whale of a time. It allowed me to experience a sense of freedom and exhilaration. Although it was a bit tiring, it is still one of the best experiences that I've ever had.



呈现让步的语言：

Although it was a bit tiring, ...

Despite/ In spite of the fact that...

Despite it all, it's still worth it.

Having said that,...



消极情绪（主要表达累就行了）

Tiring;Exhausting

Wiped out; Worn out; spent

cost me an arm and a leg





e.g. This trip was expensive and cost me an arm and a leg, having said that, I still felt over the moon.
