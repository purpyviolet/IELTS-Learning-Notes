**答案：**
 I’d like to talk about a time when I asked my high school teacher for advice about choosing a university major.

He also pointed out that AI has a promising future and could even be applied to business. His advice made a lot of sense, and after careful consideration, I chose AI as my major.

Looking back, I feel really grateful for his guidance. His advice helped me make a well-informed decision, and I haven't regretted it. It also taught me the importance of seeking help from experienced people when facing important choices.

_"One of the most interesting buildings I’ve ever seen is my university’s library. What makes it unique is its striking trapezoid—or more accurately, parallelogram—shape, which gives it a modern and futuristic look. The library stands right in front of the university’s main entrance, making it a significant landmark on campus.

Its exterior is covered in striped brown panels, which create a warm yet contemporary aesthetic. Unlike most libraries that sit directly on the ground, this one has an elevated two-story base, meaning you have to climb a wide set of stairs before reaching the entrance. This design makes the building feel grand and almost ceremonial as you walk up.

Inside, the library has five floors, each dedicated to different types of books and study areas. But my favorite feature is the rooftop garden. It’s a peaceful retreat where students can take a break, get some fresh air, and even enjoy a panoramic view of the campus.

This library is not just a place for reading—it’s a symbol of knowledge, creativity, and inspiration. Every time I step inside, I feel motivated to learn and explore new ideas."_

The first two days were dedicated to brainstorming ideas, collecting data, and developing our approach. Since the problem was open-ended, we had to explore multiple possibilities before settling on the most effective method. Collaboration was key, as we had to divide tasks efficiently—some of us worked on mathematical equations, while others focused on programming and writing the report.

The last night was the most challenging. We pulled an all-nighter, reviewing our models, refining our calculations, and making sure everything was polished. Time was running out, and the pressure was immense. In the final hour before the deadline, we double-checked our work and submitted it just in time.

Although it was exhausting, the sense of accomplishment was incredible. The competition not only tested our problem-solving skills but also strengthened our teamwork and resilience. It was a truly unforgettable experience."_

Over time, I also started watching chess tournaments online and studying famous games played by grandmasters.

Nowadays, I don’t play chess every day, but I try to play at least once or twice a week.

_"Last year, I had the chance to watch a live performance by my favorite post-rock band, and it was one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life.

The concert took place in a livehouse, which was an intimate indoor venue of around 300 square meters. Unlike traditional concert halls, there were no chairs, so everyone had to stand. This created a more immersive and energetic atmosphere, as the audience could move freely and fully engage with the performance.

From the moment the band started playing, I was completely drawn into the music. The lighting was dim but perfectly matched the mood of each song, creating an almost dreamlike experience. The sound was powerful yet delicate, making me feel as if the music was resonating deep within my soul. Throughout the two-hour performance, the band played some of their most well-known pieces, and the audience was fully captivated.

The highlight of the night was the encore performance. Just when we thought the show was over, the band returned to the stage and played my all-time favorite song. It was an incredibly emotional moment, and I felt completely overwhelmed with joy and nostalgia.

#### **🎤 答案**

_"One law that I strongly believe should be changed is the current regulation on juvenile crime. In many places, minors who commit serious crimes receive very lenient punishment, which I think is unfair to both the victims and society.

The reason I want to change this law is that youth crime rates have been rising, and some teenagers take advantage of their age to commit crimes without facing serious consequences. This not only puts innocent people at risk but also fails to teach these young offenders a proper lesson.

If I had the power to modify this law, I would introduce stricter regulations. While I do believe that minors should be given a chance to reform, there should also be appropriate punishments to ensure they take responsibility for their actions. At the same time, rehabilitation programs should be improved, offering psychological counseling and education to help young offenders integrate back into society in a positive way.

This change would greatly benefit society. It would deter potential juvenile offenders, provide justice for victims, and ultimately create a safer and more responsible community. A well-balanced law would ensure that young people learn from their mistakes while still being given a chance to turn their lives around."_

_"The person I want to talk about is not a famous activist or a scientist, but my parents. They are very committed to protecting the environment in their daily lives, and their efforts have had a great influence on me.

One of the things they do consistently is waste sorting. Every day after dinner, they carefully separate different types of waste. Plastic bottles and metal cans are collected and taken to the recycling station, while food waste is properly sorted to make disposal easier. They never throw everything into one trash bin, no matter how small the waste is.

This is something they do every single day, and it has become a natural habit for them. I remember asking my parents why they bother putting in so much effort when others don’t, and their answer was simple: “If we don’t take action, who will?” Their strong sense of responsibility toward the environment has truly inspired me.

I admire them not only because of their environmental awareness but also because they set a great example for the people around them. Through their small yet meaningful actions, they are contributing to a greener and more sustainable future."_

By completely turning it off, I create a distraction-free environment where I can fully immerse myself in my work.

In addition to eliminating distractions, I use a study technique known as the Pomodoro Technique. This method involves setting a timer for 45 to 50 minutes, during which I work without interruptions. Once the timer goes off, I take a short five-minute break before starting the next session. This approach helps me maintain efficiency and prevents burnout.

At the beginning of the day, I also create a to-do list with specific study goals. Having clear objectives not only gives me a sense of direction but also adds a feeling of urgency, preventing me from procrastinating. When I know I have limited time to complete a task, I am less likely to get distracted or waste time on unimportant things.

I usually follow this routine whenever I need to focus on a challenging subject or prepare for an exam. Over time, I have noticed significant improvements in my productivity and concentration. More importantly, this habit has helped me reduce stress and anxiety. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by a huge workload, I break it down into manageable tasks, making everything feel more achievable. At the end of the day, knowing that I have spent my time productively gives me a great sense of accomplishment."_

### **🎤 答案**

_"Recently, I have made a positive change in my daily routine by starting to run in the afternoon before dinner or in the evening after finishing my studies. This change has had a great impact on both my physical and mental well-being.

At first, it was quite difficult to develop this habit. I used to be someone who preferred staying indoors, especially after a long day of studying. However, as the weather became warmer, I decided to step out and take a short walk. Gradually, I convinced myself to start jogging at a slow pace, then increased my speed and distance over time. Now, running has become a part of my routine, and I actually enjoy it.

There are several reasons why I consider this a positive change. First, running regularly keeps me fit and improves my lung and heart health. Since my university conducts an annual physical fitness test, which is linked to scholarships, staying active helps me perform well in those assessments. Additionally, running has proven to be a great way to relieve stress. Whenever I feel overwhelmed with academic pressure, going for a run allows me to clear my mind and refresh myself.

Most importantly, this habit has significantly improved my mood and overall energy levels. Instead of feeling exhausted after a long day, I feel more active and refreshed. Looking back, I realize how beneficial this change has been, and I plan to continue this healthy routine for the long term. It gives me a sense of achievement and makes my daily life more structured and meaningful."_

### **📌 关键词**

1. **Decision to shorten competition paper**（缩短比赛论文）
2. **Mathematical modeling competition**（数学建模比赛）
3. **Word limit constraint**（字数限制）
4. **Removing valuable methods**（放弃有价值的方法）

9. **Higher evaluation from judges**（获得更高评价）
10. **Lesson on prioritization**（学会优先排序）

### **🎤 答案**

_"One of the most difficult decisions I have ever made was during a mathematical modeling competition when I had to shorten our research paper to meet the strict word limit.

This happened last year when my team and I participated in a prestigious modeling competition. After days of hard work, we developed several innovative methods to solve the given problem. However, when we were preparing to submit our final report, we realized that our paper was nearly twice the allowed length. The rules were clear—if our paper exceeded the limit, it would be disqualified.

It took us almost an entire day to make this decision. At first, we tried to reduce the length by simplifying some explanations, but that was not enough. We were then faced with a tough choice: either keep all our methods and risk violating the word limit, or remove some valuable techniques to ensure compliance. After several rounds of team discussion, I ultimately decided that we had to sacrifice some of our methods and focus only on the most essential ones.

This decision was extremely difficult because we had put a lot of effort into developing those methods, and they all had their merits. However, in the end, it turned out to be the right choice. By making our report more concise and focused, we improved its readability and clarity. As a result, we received a higher evaluation from the judges, and our work was recognized among the top submissions. This experience taught me an important lesson about prioritization—sometimes, making difficult choices is necessary for achieving a better outcome."_

_"A time when my smartphone played a crucial role in solving an important issue was last year, when I almost failed to submit a critical application due to a lost document.

I was preparing to submit an application to an official institution, which required a set of essential documents. However, just as I was about to leave, I realized that I had forgotten one of the key papers in my dormitory. Since I was already at the institution, going back to retrieve it would have taken too much time, and the submission deadline was approaching quickly.

At that moment, my smartphone became my lifesaver. I immediately called one of my dormitory mates and asked him to check my desk for the missing document. Luckily, he found it and quickly took a clear photo of it, sending it to me via messaging app. I then rushed to a nearby printing shop, printed out the document, and submitted it just in time.

This experience made me deeply appreciate the convenience of smartphones. Without my phone, I would have missed the deadline and possibly lost an important opportunity. I felt an immense sense of relief and gratitude, realizing how technology can help us handle unexpected situations efficiently. Since then, I have developed the habit of double-checking my documents before leaving for any important event."_

A special day out doesn’t always have to be expensive to be memorable. There are many ways to enjoy a great day without spending much—visiting a park, having a picnic, or simply exploring a new place on foot. Sometimes, the best experiences come from simple activities that focus on spending quality time with loved ones rather than spending money.

#### **Overview**

Last summer, I had such an experience when my friends and I decided to go for a budget-friendly outing. We wanted to relax and enjoy nature without spending too much, so we chose to visit a large public park near our city. Since it was easily accessible by bus and had free entry, it was the perfect destination for a fun yet inexpensive day.

#### **Details**

We planned ahead by preparing homemade sandwiches, snacks, and drinks, so we wouldn’t need to buy food there. The park was vast, with a beautiful lake, walking trails, and open green spaces. We spent the afternoon having a picnic, playing card games, and just chatting under the shade of a big tree.

Observing wild animals in their natural habitat is a rare and exciting experience. Unlike seeing animals in a zoo, where they are confined to small spaces, visiting a wildlife park or a natural reserve allows people to see animals roaming freely. Such places not only provide a closer connection to nature but also raise awareness about the importance of wildlife conservation.

#### **Overview**

When I was around 10 years old, my family and my friend’s family traveled to Australia. One of the most memorable parts of the trip was visiting a wildlife park where we could see kangaroos up close. Since I had only seen them on TV before, I was thrilled to finally observe them in real life.

#### **Details**

The wildlife park was located in a vast, open area surrounded by beautiful greenery. It had different sections for various animals, but the most exciting part was the kangaroo area. Visitors were allowed to walk through a designated path where kangaroos roamed freely.

As we walked through the park, we spotted several kangaroos resting under the trees. We cautiously approached them, keeping a safe distance of about five meters. Seeing them hopping around in their natural environment was an unforgettable experience. Though we were not allowed to touch them for safety reasons, just observing them up close was exciting.

Later, we had lunch at the park’s restaurant. To my surprise, the menu included kangaroo meat, prepared like a steak. Out of curiosity, I decided to try a small piece, but I found it quite tough and not as flavorful as regular beef.

#### **Feelings**

I felt a deep sense of peace and excitement during the visit. The park was a beautiful place, far away from the noise of the city, offering a perfect escape into nature. At the same time, I was thrilled to see kangaroos up close for the first time. It was a moment I had only imagined before, making it a truly unforgettable experience.

#### **Significance**

This visit made me appreciate the beauty of nature and the importance of protecting wildlife. Seeing animals in their natural environment rather than in captivity changed my perspective on conservation. It also sparked my curiosity about different ecosystems and encouraged me to explore more places where nature and wildlife thrive.

### **弄丢贵重物品**

**Describe a time when you lost a valuable item**

You should say:

- **When and where it happened**: *Last year at the Singapore National Art Museum*
  - *Keywords*: museum, travel, unforgettable, unfortunate, personal loss

- **How valuable it was**: *It accompanied me throughout my university life and carried a lot of memories*
  - *Keywords*: emotional attachment, nostalgia, university memories, rainy days
- **How you lost it**: *Left it on the top floor of the museum while resting, and when I returned, it was gone*
  - *Keywords*: carelessness, regret, lost and found, disappointment, lesson learned
- **And explain how you felt about the experience**: *I was really sad, but it taught me to be more careful and less emotionally attached to material things.*
  - *Keywords*: sadness, reflection, responsibility, life lesson, practicality



#### **Background**

Losing a valuable item is always frustrating, but when the item holds sentimental value, the experience can be even more painful. Sometimes, an object is not just a physical possession—it carries memories, emotions, and personal significance. This makes its loss feel like losing a part of one’s past.

#### **Overview**

Last year, I experienced this firsthand when I lost my favorite umbrella during a visit to the Singapore National Art Museum. Although it was just an ordinary umbrella, I had used it throughout my entire university life, making it a meaningful part of my daily routine.

#### **Details**

That day, I was enjoying the museum’s exhibitions with my friends, completely immersed in the beautiful artworks. As we explored different floors, we eventually reached the top floor, where we decided to take a short break. I placed my umbrella beside my seat and didn’t think much about it.

After finishing our break, we continued our tour and eventually left the museum. It wasn’t until we were outside that I realized I had left my umbrella behind. I immediately rushed back to the top floor, but it was already gone. I asked the museum staff if anyone had turned it in, but no one had seen it.

#### **Feelings**

I felt really upset for the next few days. That umbrella had been with me through countless rainy days, offering protection and comfort. Losing it made me realize how much I had unknowingly relied on it. At the same time, I was frustrated with myself for being careless.

#### **Significance**

This experience taught me two valuable lessons. First, I need to be more mindful of my belongings and always double-check before leaving a place. Second, I realized that while objects can carry sentimental value, it is ultimately the memories associated with them that matter most. Losing the umbrella didn’t erase the experiences I had with it, and moving forward, I learned to cherish memories rather than just physical objects.
