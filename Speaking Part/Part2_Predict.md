 I’d like to talk about a time when I asked my high school teacher for advice about choosing a university major.

At that time, I was torn between studying artificial intelligence and business. I enjoyed both subjects but wasn’t sure which one suited me better. So, I decided to ask my math teacher, Mr. Wang, for guidance because he was knowledgeable and had given me great advice in the past.

He patiently listened to my concerns and asked me about my interests and long-term goals. Then, he suggested that AI might be a better fit since I loved problem-solving and technology. He also pointed out that AI has a promising future and could even be applied to business. His advice made a lot of sense, and after careful consideration, I chose AI as my major.

Looking back, I feel really grateful for his guidance. His advice helped me make a well-informed decision, and I haven't regretted it. It also taught me the importance of seeking help from experienced people when facing important choices.
