### **话题4：社交与人际关系**

**问题：Do you think face-to-face communication is better than online communication?（你认为面对面交流比线上交流更好吗？）**

📝 **高分答案：** I believe both forms of communication have their own advantages, but face-to-face interaction is generally more effective.
 **First of all, in-person communication allows people to express emotions more clearly**. Body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice all contribute to better understanding.
 **Moreover, face-to-face conversations are less likely to be misunderstood** compared to text messages, which often lack emotional depth.
 **For example**, a simple text saying "I'm fine" can have multiple meanings depending on the context.
 **However, online communication is undoubtedly more convenient**, especially for long-distance relationships. Video calls and instant messaging enable people to stay connected despite geographical barriers.
 **In my opinion, while digital communication is useful, nothing can truly replace the warmth and authenticity of face-to-face interactions.**

**💡 高分亮点：**

- **高级词汇**：emotional depth, geographical barriers, authenticity
- **高阶句型**：对比 in-person & online communication，逻辑清晰
- **深入分析**：既提到面对面的优点，也承认线上交流的便利性
