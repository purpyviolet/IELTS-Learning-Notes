## 关于旅行经历

Describe a car trip that you went on.

I am going to talk about a time when I took a road trip along the Quebec in Canada. It was about 6 years ago that I wen on this trip. At that time, I just have my summer vacation after the semester. My cousin went to Canada for study, and we had been 2 years not seeing each other. So we thought it would be a good idea to go on a trip together, just to create some beautiful memories.

We embarked on our road trip from Montreal, setting out to explore the picturesque province of Quebec. Our first stop was Quebec City, where we wandered through its historic streets adorned with charming old buildings and sampled delicious local cuisine at quaint cafes. The city's French influence was palpable, adding to its unique allure.

Continuing our journey, we headed into the Laurentian Mountains, where we immersed ourselves in nature. We hiked scenic trails surrounded by lush forests, encountering breathtaking waterfalls and stumbling upon serene lakes nestled among the trees. The tranquil beauty of the Laurentians was a stark contrast to the bustling city life we had left behind.

During our travels, we also had the pleasure of attending a traditional Québécois festival. The festival was a vibrant celebration of music, dance, and culinary delights, providing us with a deeper understanding of the province's rich cultural heritage.

As our road trip came to an end and we returned to Montreal, we reminisced about the unforgettable moments we had shared. This journey not only allowed us to explore Quebec's diverse landscapes but also strengthened the bonds between us as a family.

In summary, our road trip through Quebec was a delightful adventure filled with exploration, discovery, and cultural immersion. It left us with cherished memories and a profound appreciation for the beauty and charm of this captivating province.



## 关于难忘的（令人惊讶的，有意外的）旅行事件

During our road trip through Quebec, our journey was not without its unexpected events. As we were cruising along the scenic highways, enjoying the stunning landscapes, we encountered a moment of tension when my uncle's speeding caught the attention of a vigilant police officer. Flashing lights and a siren disrupted the tranquil drive, and we found ourselves pulled over on the side of the road. The officer, firm but fair, issued a speeding ticket, a reminder to all of us to adhere to the traffic rules even amidst the excitement of exploration.

Another memorable incident occurred when my dad indulged in the local cuisine, particularly a renowned Boston lobster dish. Unfortunately, shortly after relishing the delicacy, he experienced an unexpected allergic reaction. Red rashes appeared on his skin, and we realized he was having an allergic response to the lobster. This unexpected turn required us to quickly seek medical assistance, a reminder of the importance of being mindful of food allergies, especially when trying new dishes in unfamiliar places.

Despite these unforeseen events, we managed to navigate through these challenges together, learning valuable lessons about safety and health while on the road. These incidents became unique anecdotes that added a touch of unpredictability to our otherwise adventurous road trip through Quebec.





## 难忘的学习经历，工作经历，研究经历

Speaking of memorable learning experiences, I would like to mention a time when I was a freshman in college. During this period, I took on a challenging engineering design project as a beginner. Our task was to create a navigation aid device for the visually impaired, integrating hardware sensors with a microcontroller board and developing corresponding software.

Early on, we encountered difficulties with the hardware components. The sensors we selected did not communicate properly with the microcontroller, leading to setbacks in our progress. Additionally, as we delved into software development, we faced coding errors and compatibility issues that seemed daunting to resolve.

However, instead of being discouraged, we approached each challenge with determination and perseverance. We sought guidance from professors and conducted extensive research to better understand the technical aspects of our project. Through trial and error, we gradually identified the root causes of our problems and implemented strategic solutions to overcome them.

One significant breakthrough was when we successfully established the connection between the sensors and the microcontroller, allowing data to be processed accurately. This achievement motivated us to push forward, refining our software algorithms and conducting thorough testing to ensure the functionality and reliability of our navigation aid device.

In conclusion, the engineering design project was a transformative experience that shaped my approach to learning and problem-solving. It emphasized the importance of resilience, teamwork, and strategic thinking in overcoming obstacles. By navigating through challenges and emerging triumphant, I gained confidence in my abilities and a deeper appreciation for the learning process. This journey remains a cornerstone of my academic and personal growth, highlighting the rewards of persistence and determination in pursuing ambitious goals.
