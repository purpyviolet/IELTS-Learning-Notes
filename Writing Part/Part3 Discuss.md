Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.



Some people hold the point that university or college contribute best to a successful career while others think that it's better to find a job straight after school. In my opinion, I support the former one.

For the former opinion, it revels the thought that students can obtain professional skills and accumulate expertise after they enter the university. In this sense, when they intend to find a job, the skills they learnt at school may help them get the job more easily and even get promotions after they start the employment. Also when they are facing the problem, they can think of a better solution by theoretical analysis. On the opposite side, if they don't go to college, they won't get any knowledge or skills before they find the job. As a consequence, they become less competitive when seeking for employment. What's more, due to the lack of skills and knowledge, they can't probably find the job that really needs advanced skills, as a result of which they have to spend more time to get promotion. By contrast, if one choose to study at university are more possible to get a brighter career.

For the latter opinion, it shows the idea that students are not compulsorily needed to go to the college. Instead, they can just go to get a work right after high school. In this situation, they can get more time working in the society, which can help them obtain more practical skills. These skills are different from the skills learnt from the college, which is more hands-on. Also
