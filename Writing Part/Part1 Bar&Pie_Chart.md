## Planning 概述

**Overview:**

coffee↑, banana↑

UK++ for both

It is clear that sales of Fairtrade coffee rose in all five European countries from 1999 to 2004, but sales of Fairtrade bananas only went up in three out of five countries. Overall, the UK saw by far the highest levels of spending on the two products.



**Paragraph 1(按照种类分类):**

The sales figure for **coffee** in Switzerland was the highest at 3 million euros in 1999, and its sales doubled in 2004. The sales in the UK, on the other hand, was just half of that in Switzerland in 1999, but there was a remarkable increase in the amount of coffee sold in the UK over the period, with 20 million coffee sales in 2004. Other countries also experienced slight rises, ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 million, in coffee sales.



**Paragraph 2:**

By contrast, much more **bananas** were sold in the UK than any other countries in
each year, with sales at 15 million in 1999 and at 47 million in 2004 respectively. The
Fairtrade-labelled bananas had also become increasingly popular in Switzerland and Belgium, and the revenue both saw an over fivefold increase. Finally, the money spent on bananas fell by 0.8 million euros in Belgium and 1.1 in Sweden respectively.



或者按照国家分类：
Paragraph 1(UK & Switzerland):

In 1999, Switzerland had the highest sales of Fairtrade coffee, at 3 million euros, while revenue from Fairtrade bananas was the highest in the UK, at 15 million euros. By 2004, however, sales of Fairtrade coffee in the UK had risen to 20 million euros, and this was over three times higher than Switzerland’s sales figure for coffee in that year. The year 2004 also saw dramatic increases in the money spent on Fairtrade bananas in the UK and Switzerland, with revenues rising by 32 and 4.5 million euros respectively.



Paragraph 2(Other countries):

Sales of the two Fairtrade products were far lower in Denmark, Belgium and Sweden.
Small increases in sales of Fairtrade coffee can be seen, but revenue remained at 2 million euros or below in all three countries in both years.
Finally, it is noticeable that the money spent on Fairtrade bananas actually fell in Belgium and Sweden.
