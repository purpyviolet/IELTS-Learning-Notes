## Planning 概述

**Overview:**

coffee↑, banana↑

UK++ for both

It is clear that sales of Fairtrade coffee rose in all five European countries from 1999 to 2004, but sales of Fairtrade bananas only went up in three out of five countries. Overall, the UK saw by far the highest levels of spending on the two products.



**Paragraph 1(按照种类分类):**

The sales figure for **coffee** in Switzerland was the highest at 3 million euros in 1999, and its sales doubled in 2004. The sales in the UK, on the other hand, was just half of that in Switzerland in 1999, but there was a remarkable increase in the amount of coffee sold in the UK over the period, with 20 million coffee sales in 2004. Other countries also experienced slight rises, ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 million, in coffee sales.



**Paragraph 2:**

By contrast, much more **bananas** were sold in the UK than any other countries in
each year, with sales at 15 million in 1999 and at 47 million in 2004 respectively. The
Fairtrade-labelled bananas had also become increasingly popular in Switzerland and Belgium, and the revenue both saw an over fivefold increase. Finally, the money spent on bananas fell by 0.8 million euros in Belgium and 1.1 in Sweden respectively.



或者按照国家分类：
Paragraph 1(UK & Switzerland):

In 1999, Switzerland had the highest sales of Fairtrade coffee, at 3 million euros, while revenue from Fairtrade bananas was the highest in the UK, at 15 million euros. By 2004, however, sales of Fairtrade coffee in the UK had risen to 20 million euros, and this was over three times higher than Switzerland’s sales figure for coffee in that year. The year 2004 also saw dramatic increases in the money spent on Fairtrade bananas in the UK and Switzerland, with revenues rising by 32 and 4.5 million euros respectively.



Paragraph 2(Other countries):

Sales of the two Fairtrade products were far lower in Denmark, Belgium and Sweden.
Small increases in sales of Fairtrade coffee can be seen, but revenue remained at 2 million euros or below in all three countries in both years.
Finally, it is noticeable that the money spent on Fairtrade bananas actually fell in Belgium and Sweden.

### 主体段结构：

第一段：写主题下降趋势的部分

<img src="Part1 Bar&Pie_Chart.assets/image-20250227141944734.png" alt="image-20250227141944734" style="zoom: 33%;" />

2. several times 与 once a week的趋势一致（先上升到顶点后下降）
3. once or twice a month 先下降后上升
4. a few times a year 先上升后平稳

1，2放在第一段，3，4放在第二段

#### 主体段1：

From 2003 to 2006, the percentage of people who had never eaten or eaten every day at these restuarants had fallen by 1% from the original 5% and 4% respectively. Since 2006, no changes had occurred in these segments of the chart. During the same period, the figures for those eating fast food once and several times on a weekly basis also decreased to about 27% and 15%, despite their peaking at 33% and 20% in 2006.

#### 主体段2：

There was an opposite trend for the population eating at such facilities monthly or a few times a year. Although the proportion of the former had seen a dramatic decrese in 2006, it increased to 33% and constituted the largest part of the population in 2013. The latter experienced a marginal increment to 15% in 2006 and remained the same until 2013.

### overview

Overall, the most developed areas among the six mainly use water for industry while the less developed ones use water mostly in the agricultural sector. Among all areas, Europe has the largest proportion of water for industrial purposes, while the figure for agricultural use is the highest in Central Asia.

### 思路1

#### 主体段1

People in North America and Europe use water with slight differences. More than half (53%) of the consumption in Europe is for industrial production, slightly higher than 48% in North America. Conversely, 7% more water is needed in the former than the latter for agricultural sue. In both continents, less than 20% is for domestic consumption.

#### 主体段2

In these two regions, industry is the biggest consumer of water. In Europe, slightly over a half is used by this sector, while a third is for agricultrual purposes. Household use the smallest amount, 15%. In North America, water use for agriculture constitutes 39% of the total, moderately higher than that in Europe. In addition, almost a half is consumed by industry, while domestic use is made up of merely 13%.



### 思路2

Key features

Agriculture > industry and domestic

Agriculture +++ in CA

domestic +++ in SA

Details

Agriculture: 80% + (except SA 71%)

Industry: much lower < 15%

Domestic: <20%, SA 19%

#### 主体段1

There are different patterns in other areas. The majority fof water is consumed for agriculture, with proportion reaching 88% in Central Asia and ranging between 70% and 85% in other three places. In contrast, the figures for ther other two purposes are considerably lower. As for domestic use, except 19% in South America, the data are below 10%, and for industrial productions, the percentages are no larger than 15%.



#### 主体段2

The other four regions saw great use of water in the agricultural sector. Africa and central Asia use the largest amounts in agriculture, at 84% and 86% respectively, while industry and households share the rest nearly equally. Around four fifths of all water consumed in Southeast Asia is for agricultural use. While 12% goes to industry, the remaining 7% is for domestic use. In South America, households are also the lowest consumer of water (10%), but industry uses almost twice as much. The remainder (71%) is all for agriculture.

The third ranking country in production and consumption of electricity was Russia, with the figures merely one fifth of those of China.



#### 主体段2

For the rest countries, the amounts of electricity generation and consumption all fell within the spread of between 450 and 950 billion kWh. While Germany consumed about 60 billion kWh more than it produced, the amounts of electricity Korea produced and used were the lowest at no more than 500 billion kWh.

### Planning

overview:

1. banana整体都有上升趋势

2. latin的banana上升幅度很大，同时本身出口就很多
3. 图二中Distribution & Retail占比很多



detail paragraph1：

1. 1993 LA有5million，是别的5倍
2. 2003 LA有11million，相比自己翻了1倍
3. FE到达1.2，Africa到达0.8

detail paragraph2：

1. D&R 占比非常多，达到了三分之一，producers占比很少，只有5%
2. exporters 占比最少，只有4%
3. profit第二多占比，18%；taxes第三多，为16%
4. shipping & import licenses



### Overview

Overall, this period saw a rise in the number of bananas from all exporting areas with Latin American exporters shipping most bananas in both years. Although the largest part of the banana export cost was from distribution and retail, the cost of each part was unevenly distributed.



### Detail para 1

In 1993, the largest banana exports came from Latin America at about 5 million tonnes, which was almost **five times more** than the rest of world combined. By 2003, Latin American exports had noticeably increased to 11 million tonnes, **twice its figure** in 1993. **By contrast**, exporters in Far East were responsible for 1.2 million tonnes, followed by African shippers with less than 1 million tonnes.



### Detail para 2

The cost breakdown of bananas reveals that over one third of the cost went to distribution centres and retailers, whereas producers received merely 5%, and exporters 4%, of the value of the crop. Profit and taxes accounted for the second and third largest proportion of the cost each banana sold at 18% and 16% respectively. Finally, figures for shipping and import licensing **were roughly the same**.
