# Part 1 高级连接词、从句

在高分雅思写作中，合理使用 **从句** 和 **高级连接词** 能让句子更复杂、更流畅，提高语言的准确性和多样性。以下是一些**常见从句结构和连接词**，并结合 **bar chart** 和 **pie chart** 的语境来展示如何使用它们。

------

## **一、使用定语从句（Relative Clauses）**

定语从句可以用来**补充说明某个类别或数据的特征**，避免简单句的重复。

🔹 **基础句**：

> *The percentage of people using public transport was the highest at 40%.*（40%的人使用公共交通，占比最高。）

🔹 **升级版**（添加定语从句）：

> *The percentage of people using public transport, **which stood at 40%**, was the highest among all categories.*（使用公共交通的人占40%，这一比例在所有类别中最高。）

📌 **其他示例**：

- *The proportion of energy generated from coal, **which accounted for nearly half of the total**, was significantly higher than that from renewable sources.*
   （煤炭发电的比例占据近一半，远高于可再生能源。）
- *The largest share belonged to the USA, **which contributed over 30% to the total consumption**.*
   （美国占据最大份额，贡献了超过30%的总消费量。）

------

## **二、使用状语从句（Adverbial Clauses）**

状语从句可以**解释原因、结果、对比等**，使句子更加流畅和逻辑清晰。

### **1. 表示对比（while, whereas, although, even though）**

🔹 **基础句**：

> *The percentage of car users was 60%, and the percentage of bus users was 30%.*

🔹 **升级版（使用 whereas）**：

> *The percentage of car users **was 60%, whereas** the proportion of those using buses was **only half as much**, at 30%.*
>  （汽车使用率为60%，而公交车仅占一半，为30%。）

📌 **其他示例**：

- *While the majority of energy came from fossil fuels, renewable sources accounted for a relatively small proportion.*
   （尽管大部分能源来自化石燃料，可再生能源的比例相对较小。）
- *Although the percentage of urban residents owning a house was high, the figure for rural areas was even greater.*
   （尽管城市居民的住房拥有率很高，但农村地区的比例更大。）

### **2. 表示因果（because, since, as, so that）**

- *Since the proportion of renewable energy is relatively low, reliance on fossil fuels remains high.*
   （由于可再生能源的比例较低，对化石燃料的依赖仍然较高。）
- *The percentage of students choosing science subjects was higher than that of arts, **possibly because** of better career prospects in this field.*
   （选择科学类科目的学生比例高于艺术类，可能是因为该领域的职业前景更好。）

------

## **三、使用名词性从句（Noun Clauses）**

名词性从句可以**让数据的描述更加抽象和复杂**，适合**概述和总结**。

🔹 **基础句**：

> *The chart shows that 40% of people preferred fast food.*

🔹 **升级版（使用名词性从句）**：

> *What stands out from the chart is that **nearly half of the respondents** preferred fast food over other meal options.*
>  （图表中最突出的一点是，**近一半受访者**更喜欢快餐而非其他饮食选择。）

📌 **其他示例**：

- *One striking feature of the data is that the proportion of online shoppers has significantly increased.*
   （数据中一个显著特点是，网购者的比例大幅上升。）
- *It is noticeable that the use of coal as an energy source has dramatically declined.*
   （可以注意到，煤炭作为能源的使用量大幅下降。）

------

## **四、使用分词短语（Participial Phrases）**

分词短语可以**让句子更加简洁，同时表达原因、结果或补充说明**。

🔹 **基础句**：

> *The number of electric vehicle users increased significantly, and this led to a decrease in fuel consumption.*

🔹 **升级版（使用分词短语）**：

> *The number of electric vehicle users increased significantly, **leading to** a decrease in fuel consumption.*
>  （电动车用户数量大幅增长，**从而导致**燃油消耗减少。）

📌 **其他示例**：

- *Accounting for nearly 50% of the total energy consumption, fossil fuels remained the dominant energy source.*
   （占据近50%的总能耗，化石燃料仍然是主要能源。）
- *Experiencing a sharp decline, the percentage of smokers fell from 30% to 15% over the period.*
   （吸烟者比例经历了大幅下降，从30%降至15%。）

------

## **五、使用高级连接词（Cohesive Devices）**

除了从句，还可以用一些高级连接词让句子更连贯。

🔹 **表示递进**：

- Not only... but also...

  （不仅……而且……）

  - *Not only did the USA have the highest energy consumption, but it also led in carbon emissions.*
     （美国不仅能源消耗最高，而且碳排放也最多。）

- Moreover, Furthermore, In addition

  （此外）

  - *The percentage of solar energy increased considerably. Furthermore, wind energy also saw a slight growth.*

🔹 **表示因果**：

- As a result, Consequently, Hence

  （因此）

  - *The demand for electric cars surged, and as a result, battery production rose significantly.*

🔹 **表示对比**：

- On the other hand, By contrast

  （相比之下）

  - *Europe relied heavily on renewable energy. By contrast, coal was the primary source in Asia.*

## **总结**

如果想要让雅思写作的 Task 1（Bar & Pie Chart）更加高级，可以：

1. **用定语从句补充细节**（which, where, whose...）
2. **用状语从句表达因果/对比**（while, although, because...）
3. **用名词性从句增强抽象概括能力**（what, that...）
4. **用分词短语提高表达简洁度**（leading to..., accounting for...）
5. **用高级连接词增强连贯性**（not only... but also..., consequently, on the other hand...）
